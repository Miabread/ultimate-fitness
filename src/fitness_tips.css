#FitnessTips-Buttons {
/* Have links as buttons similar to  the sidebar. have on on the right one on the left. distance between sides and two buttons should be equal. text for each should always be underneath it. */ 

}

/*not sure what other css might be needed for this page so go wild. */
/* an idea might be to add some images but im not sure where or what images to add. just add it in a #FitnessTips-Main or #FitnessTip-Body tag. then idk add images to the Right of the Top words (above the buttons>
